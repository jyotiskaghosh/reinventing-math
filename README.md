# reinventing-math

Reinventing math is a scheme library that aims to implement a non-conventional mathematics.
Changing some fundamentals of math. The philosophies for the changes are as follows:

* Modulo math should be natural math. This is so because infinite lines don't exist in nature, only in math.
* Negative numbers shouldn't exist. Philosophically negative numbers make no sense, as there exists no negative quantities.
Furthermore, due to modulo math being hypothesized as natural math, they become redundant.
* Zero doesn't exist. The modulo value essentially functions as zero.
* You have to think in terms of states, rather than directions. Take a clock, 10 + 11 is akin to saying 10 - 1, as 11 and -1 are cognate. Hence, there exist only one fundamental function addition that adds states.

The aim of this project is: firstly, to experiment with these rules to find interesting insights, 
and secondly, to rebuild math upon these rules. Any contributions are welcome.
